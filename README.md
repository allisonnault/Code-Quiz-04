## Description

This quiz was created to give the user a chance to test their understanding of topics covered in the Javascript portion of our coding bootcamp. 

- The goal was to create a timed coding quiz that would dynamically update the HTML and CSS through Javascript code.
- I learned how to use Javascript to manipulate the DOM and provide an interactive user expericence. 
- Through this challenge I now have a better understanding of timer intervals, local storage, arrays, objects and loops. 


## Usage

There is a start button that will set the timer, and load the first question.

If the user selects an incorrect answer, the timer will be deducted by 10 seconds. 

For each correct answer, the users score will increase by 5. 

Once the user has selected an answer, the next question will load.

This will continue until either the time runs out, or they answer all the questions.

The user is then promted to enter their initials and save their score to the High Scores page.

Only the top 5 scores will be displayed.
